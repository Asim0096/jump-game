# Jump Game - 2D Web Game

This is a simple 2D jump game developed as a group project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game runs in the browser, and the player jumps when tapping or clicking, similar to classic mobile games.

## Team Members

- **Asim0096** – Git setup, project structure, and collaboration.
- **23majed** – JavaScript game logic (movement, jump, gravity).
- **24majed** – HTML & CSS (layout and design).

## Tools & Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git and GitHub for version control

## Git Workflow

- Created a shared GitHub repository
- Used branches for individual work
- Merged changes using pull requests
- Wrote meaningful commit messages:
  - `Initial commit by Asim0096, 23majed, 24majed`
  - `Added game logic (by 23majed)`
  - `Styled game layout (by 24majed)`

## Challenges Faced

- **Merging Conflicts**: Resolved merge issues when combining code from different branches.
- **Game Physics**: Adjusting gravity and jump timing for smooth gameplay.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Making sure the game works well on touch devices.

## Solutions

- Used consistent code formatting and communication.
- Tested regularly to avoid bugs.
- Simplified jump logic for better performance.

## How to Run

1. Download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. Click/tap to make the character jump!

## Collaboration

We used GitHub issues and pull requests to divide work and track progress.
